## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Lavalink **V4** server. You can [host your own Lavalink V4](https://lavalink.dev/getting-started) or [use a public one](https://lavalink.darrennathanael.com/NoSSL/lavalink-without-ssl/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Molten:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LanderVM/Molten-Musicbot.git
cd Molten-Musicbot
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

Now, install the required Python packages using **pip**. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. This file contains the environment variables used by the bot.

### 4. Find Your Discord Bot Token

To run the bot, youâ€™ll need a Discord bot token. Follow these steps to get your bot token:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Select your application (or create a new one).
3. In the "Bot" section, click on "Reset Token" under the "TOKEN" field. And save the token somewhere safe.
4. Scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section and enable the following:
   - **Server Members Intent**
   - **Message Content Intent**
5. Save the changes.
6. In the Installation section, make sure to add the bot to your server with the following settings and use the Install Link to invite the bot to your server:

### 5. Edit `.env` File

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add your Discord bot token. The file should look something like this:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
LAVALINK_HOST=localhost
LAVALINK_PORT=2333
LAVALINK_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass
```

Replace `your_discord_bot_token_here` with the bot token you obtained in step 4. Make sure to set the Lavalink server details correctly.

### 6. Run the Bot

Finally, run the bot using the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, your bot should be online and ready to start playing music in your Discord server.

### 7. Usage

In your Discord server, you can use the following commands to control the bot:

- `/setup` to create a new song request channel. In the song request channel you can just type any message or url and the bot will find the song and play it.

- `/help` to get a list of available commands.

## Additional Information

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure you are connected to a voice channel before trying to play music.
- Ensure your Lavalink V4 server is running and accessible.
- If you get errors related to missing dependencies, make sure you have all packages installed from `requirements.txt`.
